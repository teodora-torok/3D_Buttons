This project demonstrates the creation of two stylish 3D buttons using HTML and CSS. 
The buttons feature shadow effects and smooth hover animations that give them a dynamic, interactive feel. 
The design utilizes the Boogaloo font from Google Fonts, which adds a playful and modern look to the buttons.
